Lets you find out what you've actually done the past hour.

This program continuously monitors what program you currently have in focus in Windows and tracks the time you spent in each program. Tabs in webbrowsers are monitored separately. You can then exclude/include specific programs in order to get a metric of how much active time you have spent in the programs that matter.

Automatically detects when you're away from your keyboard and tracks that time separately.
